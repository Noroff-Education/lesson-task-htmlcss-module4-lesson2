# HTML and CSS Module 4

## Task 2

### Brief

In this task you should:
- Create a transition on the call-to-action anchor tags, so that when the user hovers on the anchor tag they see a shimmer move from the left of the anchor tag to the right. Hint: Use transform to rotate the shimmer.
- Create an animation on the Guitars page to show the products after a 1s delay. Hint: use opacity to slowly reveal the products.

Here is what your site should look like after the task:
